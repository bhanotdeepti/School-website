   <h1>NO CAUSE CAN BE SERVED BETTER THAN THE CAUSE OF EDUCATION</h1>
   <p style="float:left;">A sacred cause can never be exposed without the blessings of pious souls. Stephens International Public School is highly indebted to the eternal soul of Late Dr. Aparna Saini who kindled the spirit within us to work for the enlightenment of the fledgling youngsters enabling them to be the beacon of light in this competitive world. It is time for us to salute the wisdom, vision and compassion of the noble soul and rededicate ourselves to do our bit in lighting the lamp of knowledge.
